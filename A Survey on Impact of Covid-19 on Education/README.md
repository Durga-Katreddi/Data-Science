# COVID-19 Impact on Education and Students

## Abstract
The dataset "COVID-19 Impact on Education and Students" contains information related to the impact of COVID-19 on students' education and lifestyle during the pandemic. This repository includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization project aimed at understanding the online class experience of students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic brought about unprecedented changes in the education sector, with the adoption of online classes becoming a necessity. This project aims to analyze and visualize data related to students' online class experience during the pandemic. The motivation behind this analysis is to understand how students' study habits, social media preferences, and other factors influence their perception of online classes.

## Related Work
This project builds upon previous research in the field of online learning and data visualization, exploring various aspects of student engagement, study habits, and learning outcomes.

## Methods
The dataset used in this project was collected from Kaggle, consisting of student data from online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. After data cleaning and summary statistics computation, visualizations were used to understand data distribution and relationships between numeric attributes.

## Data Loading and Cleaning
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Handle missing values by dropping rows with missing values in essential columns.
- Rename columns for clarity.

## Data Exploration and Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Students who spend more time on self-study are more likely to rate their online class experience higher.
- Hypothesis 2: Students from different regions of residence spend a different amount of time on fitness activities during the pandemic.
- Hypothesis 3: The preferred social media platform for students differs based on their age group.

## Results
Results: The project aims to answer three hypotheses:
1.	Hypothesis 1: Students who spend more time on self-study are more likely to rate their online class experience higher.

## Future Work
Opportunities for further exploration and improvement of the analysis, including integrating advanced machine learning techniques for predictive analytics.

## Conclusion
The exploratory data analysis and data visualizations shed light on the online class experience of students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on online learning and can inform educators and policymakers in enhancing the online education environment.
