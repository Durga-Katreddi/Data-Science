# Uninsured Rate Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the uninsured rate among different demographics, specifically focusing on individuals aged 18 and under and those aged 18 to 64, across various states in the United States. The analysis utilizes demographic and uninsured rate data to explore trends, correlations, and predictions.

## Data Sources
- **Health Insurance Coverage Data (Years 2008-2016)**: The project uses datasets containing information on uninsured rates among different age groups, population demographics, and state-wise data.
- **Additional Data**: Any additional data sources or preprocessing steps can be mentioned here.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Initial preprocessing steps involve data cleaning, merging datasets, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This section explores the data visually using various plots and statistical analyses to understand distributions, trends, and relationships between variables.
- **Modeling**: Several regression models are trained and evaluated to predict uninsured rates for different demographic groups and states.
- **Predictions**: Utilizing trained models to predict uninsured rates for the year 2016.

## Libraries Used
The project extensively uses Python libraries for data preprocessing, modeling, visualization, and analysis. Key libraries include:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- catboost

## Model Evaluation
Regression models such as Decision Tree Regressor, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, etc., are evaluated based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to determine their predictive performance.

## Results
- **Uninsured Rate for Age 18 and Under**: Analysis reveals trends in uninsured rates across different states and demographics.
- **Uninsured Rate for Age 18 to 64**: Similar analysis is conducted for the older demographic group.
- **Predictions for 2016**: Trained models are used to predict uninsured rates for the year 2016, providing insights into potential future trends.

## Conclusion
This project sheds light on uninsured rates among different age groups and states, providing valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers.
