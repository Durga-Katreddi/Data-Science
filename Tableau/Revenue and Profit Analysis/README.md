**Sales Insights and Profitability Dashboard**

# Sales Insights and Profitability Dashboard

This project involves creating a comprehensive sales and profitability dashboard using **Tableau** and **MySQL**. The goal is to analyze key business metrics to uncover insights into revenue and profit trends, customer and product performance, and the market segment breakdown. The dataset was stored in MySQL and structured in a star schema, with the transaction table as the fact table and other tables for customers, dates, markets, and products.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Preparation
- **SQL Integration**: Connected Tableau to a MySQL database using SQL queries to extract, transform, and load (ETL) relevant data.
- **Star Schema Design**: Implemented a star schema, with a central transactions table linked to dimension tables for customers, dates, markets, and products, optimizing data for analysis.

### 2. Dashboard Overview
- **Revenue Analysis**: Created a revenue dashboard with metrics like total revenue, revenue by market, and yearly trends, helping to identify top-performing areas.
- **Profit Analysis**: Built a profit analysis dashboard that visualizes profit trends, profit margins by market, and the overall profitability of different segments.
- **Top Customers and Products**: Highlighted top 5 customers and top 5 products based on sales revenue and quantity sold.
- **Brick-and-Mortar vs. E-Commerce**: Added comparative insights on revenue, profit, and sales volume across brick-and-mortar stores versus e-commerce channels.
- **Time-Based Trends**: Included analyses by year and month for revenue and profit, enabling seasonal insights.

### 3. Key Dashboards and Visuals
- **Revenue by Market**: Visualized revenue split across markets for geographical insights.
- **Sales Quantity by Market**: Provided a breakdown of sales quantity, helping to understand market demand.
- **Profit Margin Analysis**: Illustrated profit margin variations across markets and product categories to guide pricing and cost strategies.

- **Customer Table**: Detailed customer-specific data for tailored marketing and customer engagement insights.

### 4. Interactive Elements
- **Filters and Parameters**: Added interactive filters for time (year/month) and market segments, allowing users to drill down into specific areas.
- **Top N Analysis**: Included dynamic top N filters for products and customers, enabling quick identification of high-performing segments.

### 5. Project Walkthrough
- **Video Demo**: Recorded a video walkthrough of the dashboard to demonstrate insights and functionality, emphasizing the power of data visualization in decision-making.

## Key Skills and Tools
