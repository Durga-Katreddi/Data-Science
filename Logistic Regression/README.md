# Logistic Regression for Wine Quality Prediction

## Introduction
This Python script performs logistic regression for predicting wine quality based on various features. The script reads the dataset from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance. Additionally, it visualizes the sigmoid function used in logistic regression.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Usage
1. Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed.
2. Download the dataset file (`winequality-red.csv`) and place it in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
4. The script will perform logistic regression on the data and display the accuracy of the model.
5. A visualization of the sigmoid function used in logistic regression will be displayed.

## Description
- The script loads the dataset from a CSV file and displays its top 5 rows.
- Information about the dataset including data types and missing values is provided.
- Features and target variable are selected.
- Feature scaling is applied to standardize the features.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- A logistic regression model is trained on the training data.
- Model prediction is performed on the testing data.
- Accuracy of the model is calculated and displayed.
- Visualization of the sigmoid function used in logistic regression is provided.

## Results
- The script provides the accuracy score of the logistic regression model.
- The sigmoid function used in logistic regression is visualized.
- Users can understand the concept of logistic regression and its application in binary classification tasks.
